## Additional Sources Identified (Not Yet Added):

The following sources were identified but require additional work:
- Square Books events (needs custom parser)
- The Lyric Oxford (needs custom parser)
- Proud Larry's (needs custom parser or Facebook API)
- City of Oxford events (needs custom parser)
- Gertrude C. Ford Center (needs custom parser)

These could be added later with custom HTML parsers.

## Next Steps:

The app is now ready with 14 event sources! All ICS calendars from Ole Miss Athletics are integrated. The app will:
1. Automatically fetch from all sources
2. Deduplicate events
3. Display next 3 weeks of events
4. Allow filtering by category and date
5. Provide calendar integration
6. Show events on map

## Testing Notes:

- All sources are configured
- ICS calendars follow standard format
- APIs require API keys in Streamlit secrets
- HTML parser may need adjustment if Visit Oxford website changes
