In OBSERVER, filmmaker Ian Cheney embarks on an experiment in which he brings a series of keen-eyed observers - scientists, artists, a hunter - to a range of locations around the world, often without telling them where they are going, and asks them simply to describe what they see. Oxford's own Aimee Nezhukumatathil, author and professor of English, was selected as one of the twelve \"Observers\" in this nature documentary, and you'll see her journey as she is unexpectedly, comically sent to Greenland in the middle of a Mississippi summer. This film debuted at the 2025 Copenhagen film festival and is not to be missed for anyone needing a reminder of the beauty still here on this planet. What unfolds is a deep exploration and celebration of the power of observation: what happens when you find new ways to sense and perceive the world around you? With customary whimsy and a small painted red square that Cheney brings on every journey, the film is an invitation to viewers to find beauty and meaning in even the most quotidian of locales. Award-winning director Ian Cheney will chat in-person with Aimee Nezhukumatathil after the film for an audience \"talk back\" session! https://www.observerfilm.org/meet-the-observers  |","image_hash":"3dadec3c27e70447","image_type":"category","link":"https://eventcalendar.olemiss.edu/event/observer-nature-documentary-screening","location":"Bryant Hall","source":"Ole Miss Events","start_iso":"2025-11-03T17:00:00-06:00","title":"Nov 3, 2025: OBSERVER: nature documentary screening  at Bryant Hall"},{"category":"Ole Miss Athletics","cost":"Varies","description":"Basketball game: Ole Miss vs Southeastern Louisiana","image_hash":"b6fad2f717bd9b4b","image_type":"sports","link":"https://olemisssports.com/sports/mens-basketball/schedule","location":"The Pavilion","source":"Ole Miss Men's Basketball Schedule","start_iso":"2025-11-03T19:00:00","title":"Ole Miss vs Southeastern Louisiana"},{"category":"Music","cost":"Free","description":"University of Mississippi Music and Lafayette-Oxford-University Symphony Orchestra present the 2025 LOU Side-By-Side Concert with UM Opera Theatre.

Their sumset A + B is the subset consisting of all a + b with a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B. There are many results along the lines of small sumset implies structure. For instance, when |A + B| < |A| + 2|B| \u2212 3 with G equal to the integers, then A and B must each be large subsets of arithmetic progressions (having common difference) with very precise bounds on just how large. This result derives from classical work started by Freiman, but decades later it is still an open question to fully extend it to an analogous result for G cyclic of prime order p. In this talk, I will overview the basic situation and methods used in this regime, and then focus on recent work attaining such precise inverse structure for sumsets with very high density |A + B| = (1 \u2212 \u03f5)p.  |","image_hash":"0bb42892e63321a6","image_type":"category","link":"https://eventcalendar.olemiss.edu/event/combinatorics-seminar-the-freiman-3k-4-theorem-at-high-density-modulo-p","location":"High Density Modulo p at Hume Hall","source":"Ole Miss Events","start_iso":"2025-11-05T16:00:00-06:00","title":"Nov 5, 2025: Combinatorics Seminar - The Freiman 3k \u2212 4 Theorem at High Density Modulo p at Hume Hall"},{"category":"Education","cost":"Free","description":"The International Center for Law & Economics generously provides funding for the Speaker Series.  |","image_hash":"674ae66a3043f0dc","image_type":"category","link":"https://eventcalendar.olemiss.edu/event/law-economics-speaker-series-devesh-raval-federal-trade-commission","location":"Robert C.
