## 🔍 Source Verification Details

### How It Works
1. `verify_all_sources_processed()` function:
   - Loads all sources from `data/sources.yaml`
   - Checks health report for processed sources
   - Compares lists to find missing sources
   - Displays warning if discrepancies

2. Source Processing Verification:
   - The `collect_with_progress()` function in `lib/aggregator.py` processes ALL sources from the YAML
   - Each source is processed in a loop (line 49-71)
   - Health status is tracked for each source
   - No sources are skipped

3. Display:
   - Shows total sources configured
   - Shows sources processed
   - Warns if any are missing
   - Source panel shows individual source status

### Verification Result
✅ **All 5 sources from sources.yaml are being processed correctly**
