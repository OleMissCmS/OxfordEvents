# Current Status - Oxford Events App

## Issue: App Stuck Loading on Streamlit Cloud

The Streamlit app on Cloud gets stuck in a loading state showing only the header.

## What We've Tried

1. ✅ Disabled JavaScript filter button styling
2. ✅ Disabled `@st.cache_data` on `get_logo_image` function
3. ✅ Disabled Google Fonts import
4. ✅ Simplified `load_events()` to always use mock data
5. ✅ Disabled sports logo generation
6. ✅ Switched from Unsplash to placeholder.com for images

**None of these fixes worked.** The app still hangs.

## Current App State

- **streamlit_app.py**: Main app file, uses modular imports
- **Mock data**: Returns 2 hardcoded events (Sports + Arts)
- **No real data collection**: `lib/aggregator.py` simplified
- **Minimal CSS**: Only essential styles, no Google Fonts
- **No sports logos**: Generation disabled
- **Placeholder images**: Using placeholder.com

## Why Local Development Will Help

**Current Problem**: Streamlit Cloud deployment has delays:
- 30-60 second wait for each code change
- Can't see terminal errors/logs
- Can't debug interactively

**Local Benefits**:
- ✅ Instant feedback (no deployment wait)
- ✅ See errors in terminal immediately
- ✅ Can use `print()` statements for debugging
- ✅ Faster development cycle
- ✅ Can inspect what's hanging in real-time

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Install Python and Run Locally (RECOMMENDED)

1. Follow `INSTALL_PYTHON.md` to install Python
2. Follow `RUN_LOCALLY.md` to set up environment
3. Run: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
4. Debug the hang in real-time

This will let us see exactly where the app is getting stuck.

### Option 2: Continue Cloud Debugging

Continue trying different Cloud-based fixes (slow process):
- More code modifications
- Wait for each deployment
- Hope the fix works

## Recommended Action

**Install Python and run locally.** This will give us the fastest path to fixing the loading issue.
